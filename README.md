This service allows people to connect to their web3 wallets and write short text-only news articles which become immutable when posted to the blockchain.
This allows for readers to donate via crypto to individual authors in exchange for their work.

This is a simple and functional decentralized news service which allows for micropayments. The current contract is deployed on Sonic and its verified and available:

You will need to deploy your own contract. Please note that the current contract is set to give a small percentage of payments directly to me.
While you are more than welcome to do this, lol, I would recommend you change it so it suits your needs.
